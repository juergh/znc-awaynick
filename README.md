ZNC module to change the nick when away
=======================================

This is the original upstream ZNC awaynick module as an external module.

This module was retired from upstream ZNC [1] because it's deemed inappropriate
to pollute channels with constant nick name changes. However, in certain
circumstances (private channels and such) it's an OK thing to do and it helps
lazy people to immediately see the status of users.
